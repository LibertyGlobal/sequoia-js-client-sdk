## Do you want to request a feature, ask a usage question, or report a bug?

Feature requests are new features that you would like to see in the SDK. If you are able, we would love to see new features by the community, but we will take all ideas into consideration.

If you want to ask a usage question, please make sure that there isn't a tutorial in our documentation already. If you are a client of Piksel, you should be able to ask questions to the team directly, and would get a quicker response. Questions that start with "How do I" are usually usage questions. We will endeavor to add tutorials to the documentation when needed.

Bugs need a little bit more information before we can accept them. We need to know what the current behaviour of the SDK is, and what behaviour you expect.

### What is the current behavior?

If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via [JSFiddle] or similar.

[JSFiddle]: https://jsfiddle.net

### What is the expected behavior?

Which versions of the SDK, which browser and OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of the SDK?
